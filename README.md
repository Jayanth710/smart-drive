# 🚀 SmartDrive: An Intelligent Content Platform

> **Your personal application for intelligent, content management.**

## 1. Introduction

SmartDrive is a full-stack, cloud-native application designed to be your personal content manager. It allows you to securely upload, process, and search a wide variety of files — including documents, images, and media.  

At its core, SmartDrive uses a sophisticated AI pipeline to automatically understand file content, generate concise summaries, and make everything instantly searchable through an intuitive web interface.  

The project is built on a modern microservice architecture, ensuring scalability, resilience, and efficiency across diverse workloads — from simple document parsing to intensive audio transcription.

## 2. The Problem & Our Solution

In today’s world, we’re overwhelmed with unstructured data: meeting transcripts, research papers, scanned documents, personal photos, and more. Finding what you need is like searching for a needle in a haystack.  

Commercial cloud storage solutions exist — but they often lack deep content analysis and force you to trust a third party with your most sensitive data.

**SmartDrive solves this by providing an intelligent, flexible, privacy-aware AI pipeline.**

### What makes SmartDrive different?

✅ **Privacy-Aware Processing**  
Uses open-source AI models (e.g., OCR, Whisper) in a secure, containerized environment — reducing API costs and limiting raw data exposure.

✅ **Intelligent Routing**  
A local classifier analyzes images to decide between an OCR or captioning workflow, applying the best tool for the job.

✅ **State-of-the-Art Summarization & Captioning**  
For high-quality reasoning, SmartDrive uses the Google Gemini API, combining powerful third-party summarization with cost-effective local processing.

**Open-Source Models Used**:
- Document Parsing: `unstructured`
- Image OCR: `EasyOCR`
- Audio Transcription and Video: `faster-whisper and ffmpeg`

## 4. Microservice Architecture

SmartDrive uses a **decoupled, event-driven architecture** for scalability and resilience.

**Data Flow:**

1. **Upload**  
   Authenticated User uploads a file via the Next.js frontend.  

2. **Backend Router**  
   Node.js backend saves the file to a user-specific GCS bucket, stores fileHash in MongoDB, and publishes a Pub/Sub message based on MIME type.

3. **Specialized Processing**  
   One of three Python microservices, each listening to its own Pub/Sub topic, picks up the message.

4. **Content Extraction**  
   The microservice downloads the file from GCS and uses specialized models (e.g., `unstructured`, `EasyOCR`, `faster-whisper`) to extract content.

5. **Summarization & Embedding**  
   Sends extracted content to the Google Gemini API for summarization, then creates a vector embedding.

6. **Indexing**  
   Saves the final summary, metadata, and embedding to the correct Weaviate collection.

This guarantees that, for example, a long-running transcription job will not block faster tasks like a document parse.
